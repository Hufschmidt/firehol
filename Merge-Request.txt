Topics:
  - Using -I rules due to CHAIN 'Return-Policy'
  - Due to NAT'ing, normal interface rules don't apply
    - Use DOCKER-USER rules (https://docs.docker.com/network/iptables/)
    - Better solution with firehol?
  - Added DOCKER-Ingress, docker_service
  - Strange: DOCKER-ISOLATION vs DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-*
  - docker_gwbridge name is hard-coded. Issue? 
  - Note about "service: ESP" 'port' (In addition to docker_*_ports)

Todo:
  - Simplify solution? (Less ISOLATION, no/better INGRESS/NAT'ing)
